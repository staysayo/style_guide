# GitHub Workflow for Solo Development

## Introduction
This guide provides a structured workflow for solo developers using GitHub, focusing on best practices for pull requests and issues to maintain a high-quality codebase and clear project history.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Master Branch**: The production-ready branch.
2. **Dev Branch**: Used for active development and integrating new features.
3. **Feature Branches**: Created from the dev branch for specific features or fixes.

## Issues

### Best Practices

- **Default Settings**: Initially, allow all kinds of feedback and interact with users to understand their problems and needs.
- **Milestones**: Encourage use of Github.com milestones to group issues and fixes
- **Structured Reporting**: Use issue templates to ensure that all necessary information is provided for feature requests and bug reports.

### Implementation

- Use the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to communicate the importance of searching before posting new issues.
- Set up issue templates for bugs and features using GitHubâ€™s template builder to streamline the reporting process.

## Pull Requests

### Best Practices

- **Review Your Code**: Use pull requests to review code changes, even if you are the only developer.
- **Reference Issues**: Always reference related issues in the pull request description to link discussions and changes.
- **Merge Strategically**: Only merge pull requests after thorough testing and ensure they align with the project's goals and current milestones.

### Implementation

- Integrate the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension in VSCode to manage pull requests directly from the editor.
- Use draft pull requests for work-in-progress changes to get an early feedback loop.

## Milestones

- Create milestones to represent project phases or versions.
- Link issues and pull requests to milestones to track progress.

## Conclusion

Adopting these practices will help maintain a clear, manageable solo development process, leveraging GitHub's powerful tools to enhance productivity and code quality.
